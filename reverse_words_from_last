# Write a program (using functions!) that asks the user for a long string containing multiple words. Print back to the user the same string, except with the words in backwards order. For example, say I type the string:

strings= input("Enter your string: ").split(" ")
print(" ".join(strings[::-1]))



# second method
words = input("Enter your string2 : ").split(" ")
print(words)
print(len(words))
new_words =""
for i in words[::-1]:
    new_words = (new_words+" "+i).lstrip()
print(new_words)
print(len(new_words))
