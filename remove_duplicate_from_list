#Write a program (function!) that takes a list and returns a new list that contains all the elements of the first list minus all the #duplicates.
#Extras:
#Write two different functions to do this - one using a loop and constructing a list, and another using sets.
#Go back and do Exercise 5 using sets, and write the solution for that in a different function.

    for i in list_numbers:
        if i not in new_list:
            new_list.append(i)
