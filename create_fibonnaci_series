# Write a program that asks the user how many Fibonnaci numbers to generate and then generates them.
#Take this opportunity to think about how you can use functions. Make sure to ask the user to enter the number of numbers in the sequence
#to generate.(Hint: The Fibonnaci seqence is a sequence of numbers where the next number in the sequence is the sum of the previous two 
#numbers in the sequence. The sequence looks like this: 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, â€¦)

#Using Function
user_input = int(input("Enter a number till Fibonnaci series should generate"))
def fibonnaci(itterations):
    fibonacci_series = [1, 1]
    for i in range(itterations - 2):
        third_number = fibonacci_series[len(fibonacci_series) - 2] + fibonacci_series[len(fibonacci_series) - 1]
        fibonacci_series.append(third_number)  
    return fibonacci_series
print(fibonnaci(user_input))

# Using for loop
user_input = int(input("Enter a number till Fibonnaci series should generate"))
fibonacci_numbers = [1 , 1]
for i in range(user_input -2):
    fibonacci_numbers.append(fibonacci_numbers[i] + fibonacci_numbers[i+1])
print(fibonacci_numbers)
